# MLExperiments
Experiments with building ML applications using various technologies

 1. Based on an Analytics Vidhya tutorial (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/06/build-machine-learning-model-in-your-browser-tensorflow-js-deeplearn-js/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AnalyticsVidhya+%28Analytics+Vidhya%29)
The index files contain code for creating an image recognition app in your browser using your webcam; using:
- MobileNet (https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/06/mobilenets-open-source-models-for.html) - a pre-trained 
-  ml5.js - a library built on top of TensorFlow.js, to load the MobileNet model into the  browser and perform inference on the video feed
- P5.js ibrary to process the video feed and display labels on the video itself
